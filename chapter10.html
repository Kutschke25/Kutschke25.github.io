    <h2>Automation and Employment</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning of the film we see a montage of the development of AI and robotics technologies and their integration into society.
      They show AI powered robots joining the workforce in positions with progressively more responsibilites from doing chores around the house to performing surgery.
      AI was even used to automate civil servant positions such as police officers and eventually even involved nuclear weapon control systems. 
      
      This may have lead to AI taking jobs from humans but it also led to the creation of new jobs also shown in the movie.
      In the film, human workers are shown in a manufacturing plant for simulants working side by side with traditional automated production machinery to produce robots.
      There is also a part of the film where they show a large compound where human workers are dedicated to developing new AI technologies.

    <h2>Breakthroughs in AI</h2>
    <p>
      In the film, the singularity has been achieved and AGI is readily available. This has lead to the creation of simulants which are humanlike AI-powered robots who are "more human than human"(2:00).
      The technology shown in the movie implies that they built brain like processors which mimic human biology to run AI. This is a technology beyond the deep learning models described in the book but is a topic which is currently being researched and developed: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/intel-unveils-largest-ever-ai-neuromorphic-computer-that-mimics-the-human-brain">Neuromorphic Computers</a>.
      Today there are concerns about the use of AI to misuse someone's likeness and face in malicious ways. In the film, simulants can be created to look exactly like an existing human face which opens up even more possibilites for malicious misuse of identity to commit crime and defamation. A development like this would require serious adaptaiton of current legal systems and regulations, as something as simple as a watermark will not be able to help.
      The movie also highlights the consequences of deploying powerful AI without proper oversight, especially when it comes to transparency, accountability and privacy. The movie shows how the decisions of AI systems can greatly impact human lives with little to no human oversight or accoutnability.
      The military's actions such as targeting Nirmatta, executing AI developers, and punishing civilians for harboring AI show a pattern of displacing responsibility for the actions of AI. There is a confusion about who is responsible for the actions of the AI and therefore accoutnability is freely assigned to AI and anyone associated with it. There is also the issue of only holding AI accountabile for its own decisions, which absolves humans of the accountability of their creation. This is especially prevailant when the US government takes the liberty of assigning responsibility of a nuclear warhead detonation to AI,  rather than the humans who made a mistake when designing the system.

    <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
    <p>
      The Creator displays a stark divide between a society which embraces AI, New Asia, and one which has banned it, The US. This is similar to the global divide discussed in the chapter where industrialized regions adopt advanced technologies, especially since New Asia's culture makes participating in the AI age a priority.
