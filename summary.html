    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>In The Creator, a future war rages between humans and artificial intelligence after AI detonates a nuclear bomb in America. Joshua, a ex-special forces agent grieving the loss of his wife, is recruited to hunt down and destroy a powerful weapon created by nirmata only to discover it is a childlike robot he names Alphie. This pushes him into the crossfire of the New Asian-West war, as he seeks to protect Alphie. As Joshua spends more time with Alphie he grows more attached to her, he then starts to question everything he thought about the war, humanity, and what it means to be alive. Caught between his duty and morality , he must make a choice that will alter the future of both humans and AI forever. </p>
