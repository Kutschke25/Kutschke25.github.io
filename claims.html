    <h1>Claims</h1>
    <p>Use the navigation above to explore our content.</p>

  <h2>Claim 1: War Should Not Be Automated by AI</h2>
  <p>Human judgment and accountability should remain at the center of decisions which cost human lives.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There should be regulations on automation within the military.</li>
    <li>Human lives should not be separated from war.</li>
    <li>Military personnel and government officials should still be directly connected to conflicts and warfare decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Claim 2: Targeting Systems Should Minimize Civilian Casualties</h2>
  <p>Collateral damage must be reduced by requiring AI and military targeting systems to prioritize the safety of civilians.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There were significant civilian casualties in Syria due to airstrikes.</li>
    <li>In 2019, U.S. and Afghan air forces were leading causes of civilian deaths.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>

  <h2>Claim 3: Using People’s Faces, Memories, and Identities Without Permission is a Serious Invasion of Privacy</h2>
  <p>The copying and use of memories, brain data, and identities,even after death, raises deep ethical concerns about privacy and consent.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New brain scanning technologies and brain-computer interfaces are being developed, such as Neuralink.</li>
    <li>Neuroscientists have outlined methods to theoretically upload a person’s mind into computers, requiring both scans and hardware to store consciousness.</li>

  <h2>Additional Context: Use of Robotics and AI in Military and Law Enforcement</h2>
  <p>Excerpt from discussion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    The film <i>The Creator</i> reflects many of today's struggles to agree on AI governance, and the ethical concerns of AI-driven warfare. In the film, where AI has gained sentience, Asia embraces AI while the U.S. bans it due to perceived threats. This mirrors real-world struggles to govern AI, requiring international cooperation between governments, corporations, and the public. The automation of warfare and the militarization of AI could save lives but raises concerns about global security and the possibility of an AI arms race. Regulation is increasingly difficult as AI development advances, highlighting the need for ethical guidelines and policies.
