      Early in the movie, a video spreads a false rumor that AI set off a nuclear bomb to take away jobs. This shows how quickly misinformation can spread through digital networks and cause fear or anger. Later, we see a radio broadcast about Alphie being taken, which influences how people respond to the situation. These examples show how both online platforms and traditional media are used to share information, whether it is true or not.
